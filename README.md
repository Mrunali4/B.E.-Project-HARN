# H.A.R.N. Hydro-farming with Autonomous Regulation of Nutrients

PROBLEM DEFINITION

The existing Hydroponic systems usually have automated system which is just relying on the external paraments of the plant such as temperature, humidity, etc.. Plants require nutrients to germinate, grow, fight off diseases and pests and to reproduce. A plant that lacks an essential nutrient cannot complete its life cycle. However, having too much of a nutrient can harm and even kill plants. 
Symptoms of nutrient deficiencies in plants often appear on the leaves. The leaf color and shape, therefore, and can be used to diagnose nutrient deficiencies using Image Classification.

PROPOSED SOLUTION
This method to determine nutrients deficiency in plants by capturing images and hence it provides instant results. 
CNN algorithm performs feature extraction of captured images and classifies them into different nutrients deficient categories.<hr>
